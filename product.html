        <p class="paragraph_one"> We have a product that will keep the baby warm and able to sustain themselves. Early-born baby needs at least the average temperature of around 37.0 Degree Celsius to keep the baby warm. Also, the time outside the healthy range should be under 120 minutes. This helps the baby keep healthier. To be reasonable and for every family to be able to have access to the incubator, we have tested and improved the incubator and made it low-cost. It is $93.99 and less than $100.00. This product is a portable baby incubator that will use PCMs and materials to keep the baby warm. The advantage of this baby warmer is that it is very easy to use. PCM stands for Phase Change Materials which absorb or release large amounts of energy. PCM has its own time that holds warmth. And don't worry if you used them once. You can reuse them. This is also one of the advantages of our portable baby incubator.</p></td>
